# my_first_rails_app

This project was created as part of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/your-first-rails-application). The purpose of building it was to learn how to create a simple Rails app and deploy it on Heroku. It 
simply allows one to add a car's make, model, and year to a database and display it. The working app can be found here: https://damp-hamlet-34627.herokuapp.com/
